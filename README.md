main idea:

Trajectories

Run by running the code normally.

Current version features:

4 elements:

- Player
- Target
- Obstacle (wall)
- Bounce platform (Triangle)


Edit mode Press "o":

- Press "o" to enable or disable.
- Allows for dragging (using cursor) around elements to desired location
- Includes interaction indicator (highlights the element when hovering with mouse)
- Allows for obstacle wall to move as a whole by pressing Lshift + mouse click instead of having to set the length manually with the walls start and endpoints.

Work to be done:
order of next implementations:

- Bullet shooting out of the player to hit the target:
- Aiming system for predicting trajectory path:

- Hitboxes for the wall, bouncing triangle, target, and player:

- HP system to see if it hit the target and destroys it

- The reflection system of the bullet:

- More comprehensive level design editing interface
